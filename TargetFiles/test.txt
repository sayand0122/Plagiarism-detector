Labs in 1959. The MOS transistor's advantages include high scalability,[14] affordability,[15] 
low power consumption, and high density.[16] The MOS transistor revolutionized the electronics industry,
[17][18] and is the most common semiconductor device in the world.
Information storage can be easier in digital systems than in analog ones. The noise immunity of digital
systems permits data to be stored and retrieved without degradation. In an analog system, noise from aging
and wear degrade the information stored. In a digital system, as long as the total noise is below a certain
level, the information can be recovered perfectly. Even when more significant noise is present, the use of
redundancy permits the recovery of the original data provided too many errors do not occur.
