  
The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor), also known as the MOS transistor, was
invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959.[10][11][12][13] The MOS transistor's
advantages include high scalability,[14] affordability,[15] low power consumption, and high density.[16]
The MOS transistor revolutionized the electronics industry,[17][18] and is the most common semiconductor
device in the world.[12][19] The MOS transistor has been the fundamental building block of digital
electronics since the late 20th century.

In the early days of integrated circuits, each chip was limited to only a few transistors, and the low
degree of integration meant the design process was relatively simple. Manufacturing yields were also quite
low by today's standards. The wide adoption of the MOSFET transistor by the early 1970s led to the first
large-scale integration ICs with more than 10,000 transistors on a single chip. Following the wide
adoption of CMOS, a type of MOSFET logic, by the 1980s, millions and then billions of MOS transistors
could be placed on one chip as the technology progressed, and good designs required thorough planning,
giving rise to new design methods. As of 2013, billions of MOS transistors are manufactured every day.
